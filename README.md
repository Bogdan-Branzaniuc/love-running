 # Love Running Project  
  
  This is one of the first projects that I built within Professional Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development course made by Code Institute. 
I only used HTML and CSS in this project. 

  This simple website is made out of 3 main pages: 
- A home Page,
- A gallery Page,
- A Sign Up page. 

  The only new feature I added so far is the footer animation and sizing when the page goes above 1600px width, as everything else was a step-by-step implementation of the programme.

Things that this website is not doing at the moment: 

- not linked to any database,
- not using the user's cookies,
- not using any other language than HTML and CSS.


here is the original project's read-me file:
